Monty Hall problem

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.
You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.

He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Under the standard assumptions, contestants who switch have a
2/3 chance of winning the car, while contestants who stick to their initial choice have only a
1/3 chance.

In this program we will play the game ourselves.

In terminal you have to run the code and pass additional arguments: strategy ("switch" or "stick"),
how many times you want this game to be played and how many doors should be there.

Default values are: strategy: "switch", run times: 10, doors: 3.

As a result you'll see your success percentage.

Take a look at this video to understand more clear how does it happen.

Have fun!
